This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, you should create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and add your `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY`:

```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

### Note: as of now, the API key is hardcoded in @/api/chat.ts, where you should change the url

Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### Note: this app might have missing scenarios, like the Assistant modifying the responses based on edited/delete messages. For the sake of this project, this wasn't implemented.
